# The GroupName here is used to identify your company or business unit that
# created this webhook.
# For example, this may be "acme.mycompany.com".
# This name will need to be referenced in each Issuer's `webhook` stanza to
# inform cert-manager of where to send ChallengePayload resources in order to
# solve the DNS01 challenge.
# This group name should be **unique**, hence using your own company's domain
# here is recommended.
groupName: acme.example.com
# The nameserver is the authoritative nameserver that will be returned
# in queries for the domain name. This is usually the same as the domain
nameserver: "acme.example.com."
# The domain name is the domain name / zone that will be managed by this server.
domainName: "acme.example.com."
# The rname is the email address that will be used in the SOA record, where the
# @ symbol is replaced with a dot.
rname: "admin.acme.example.com."
# The publicIP is the IP address (or CNAME) that will point to this server.
# If you don't yet have this, such as in instances where your load balancer IP
# will be dynamically assigned, you can leave this blank and update it later.
